# Get the source @ GitHub #

The source code is hosted at GitHub since Sept. 2011.

Please find it here: https://github.com/nguillaumin/osmtracker-android

The SVN repo still contains the sources before the switch to GitHub, but is not used anymore.

The main project site is still this one on Google Code and is still used for documentation and issue tracking.
