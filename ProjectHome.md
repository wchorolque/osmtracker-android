OSMTracker stands for [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) Tracker. It allows you to track your journey and mark significant way points.
Way points can be marked with a tag using a button, with a quick voice record, a text note or by taking a picture. The various button pages and layouts [can be customized](https://github.com/nguillaumin/osmtracker-android/wiki/Custom-buttons-layouts) to suit your OpenStreetMap activities. You can view your current track on top of an OpenStreetMap background.

The track is then exported in [GPX](http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) format, ready to use in OSM tools like JOSM.

This project has been mainly inspired (if not cloned !) by the great [OSMTracker](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSMtracker) for Windows Mobile devices.
I used it for months before switching to an Android device, and as there didn't seem to be any equivalent for Android, I started to develop it myself.

It's still a work in progress and needs a lot of testing and improvements. Please read the [known limitations](https://github.com/nguillaumin/osmtracker-android/wiki/Limitations) before using it. You can help by submitting patches for new features or issues, or by [translating](https://github.com/nguillaumin/osmtracker-android/wiki/Translating), like many generous contributors have already done.

Available via Android Market (Scan following barcode) or as a download on this website.
Feel free to post a [new issue](http://code.google.com/p/osmtracker-android/issues/list) for any inquiries or help.
